NLU analysis strategy
=====================

Per Flow: 

Statistics: 
- Number of intents
- AVG training samples per intent
- HI / LO no training samples
- 1st/3rd quartil no of training samples (maybe too mucht)? Maybe "normal distribution" diagram?
- No. of intent levels
- Intent hierarchy diagram

NLU Settings:
- intent mapping order/priority
- implicit slot parsing
- attached flows
- attached lexicons
- states (if any defined)
- slot fillers (if any defined)

Per intent:

- Cognigy scoring (if accessible via API)
- Diversity of training samples
- Quote annot./non-annot.
